Tests: 402 unit + 81 integration + 13 e2e = 496 total, all passing

Addresses critique scoring:
- Dialog quality (3/10→higher): voice differentiation by social class, cultural
  accuracy (Roman vs Greek deities), modern idiom prohibition, critique-and-retry loop
- Historical accuracy (5/10→higher): grounding data feeds character identification,
  literary name detection, timeline compression warnings
- Image quality (6.5/10→higher): emotional transfer (tension→physical body language),
  prompt compression to ~100 tokens, "caught moment" framing
- Structure (7/10→higher): graph pruning (2x cap, salience threshold), character
  cap reduced to 6, background characters require visible actions

New abstractions:
1. CritiqueAgent — generic post-generation reviewer, one retry max
2. Emotional transfer in optimizer — tension_arc + emotional_beats → physicalized cues
3. Grounding→CharacterID pipeline — verified_participants inform casting
4. Social register system — class-based speech pattern constraints
5. Graph salience pruning — max 2*N relationships, no neutral/stranger pairs
