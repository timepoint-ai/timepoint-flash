# How TIMEPOINT Flash Works

TIMEPOINT generates scenes using 15 specialized AI agents that each handle one part of the process
in parallel.

## The Pipeline

**Why 15 agents instead of one big prompt?**

1. **Speed** - Independent agents run in parallel, cutting time by ~40%
2. **Quality** - Each agent has a focused prompt optimized for one task
3. **Reliability** - If image generation fails, you still get the scene
4. **Visibility** - You see progress as each step completes

## What Each Agent Does

| Agent | Job | Output |
|-------|-----|--------|
| **Judge** | Is this a valid historical query? | yes/no, confidence |
| **Timeline** | When exactly? | year, month, day, time of day |
| **Scene** | Where and what's the atmosphere? | location, weather, mood |
| **Characters** | Who's there? | 8 people with names, roles, bios |
| **Graph** | How do they relate? | alliances, tensions, history |
| **Moment** | What's the dramatic tension? | stakes, conflict, emotion |
| **Dialog** | What are they saying? | 7 period-appropriate lines |
| **Camera** | How should we frame this? | composition, focal point |
| **ImagePrompt** | Describe the image in detail | ~11,000 character prompt |
| **ImageGen** | Create the image | photorealistic scene (3-tier fallback: Google → OpenRouter → Pollinations.ai) |

Plus 3 more for interactions: **Chat** (talk to characters), **Dialog Extension** (more lines), **Survey** (ask everyone the same question).

## The Graph Agent (Technical Details)

The Graph agent extracts a structured relationship network from the characters. No graph library is used—it's pure LLM extraction into a graph-ready schema.

**Schema:**

```python
# Directed edges with attributes
class Relationship:
    from_character: str      # "Brutus"
    to_character: str        # "Caesar"
    relationship_type: str   # ally|rival|enemy|subordinate|leader|mentor|family|friend|stranger|neutral
    tension_level: str       # friendly|neutral|tense|hostile
    description: str         # "Surrogate father/son, now betrayer"

# Faction clustering
class Faction:
    name: str               # "Conspirators"
    members: list[str]      # ["Brutus", "Cassius", "Casca"]
    goal: str               # "End tyranny, restore the Republic"

# Full graph output
class GraphData:
    relationships: list[Relationship]
    factions: list[Faction]
    power_dynamics: str     # "Caesar holds absolute power..."
    central_conflict: str   # "Loyalty vs. duty to Rome"
    alliances: list[str]    # Key alliance descriptions
    rivalries: list[str]    # Key rivalry descriptions
    historical_context: str # Background for relationships
```

**Example output (Caesar assassination):**

```json
{
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "Brutus", "to": "Caesar", "type": "family", "tension": "hostile"},
    {"from": "Cassius", "to": "Brutus", "type": "ally", "tension": "tense"},
    {"from": "Antony", "to": "Caesar", "type": "ally", "tension": "friendly"}
  ],
  "factions": [
    {"name": "Conspirators", "members": ["Brutus", "Cassius", "Casca"], "goal": "End tyranny"},
    {"name": "Loyalists", "members": ["Antony", "Lepidus"], "goal": "Protect Caesar"}
  ],
  "power_dynamics": "Caesar holds dictatorial power; Senate is divided",
  "central_conflict": "Republic vs. autocracy, loyalty vs. principle"
}
```

**Graph-ready:** The `Relationship.to_edge()` method returns `(from, to, type)` tuples for easy conversion to networkx/igraph if you want to add visualization.

## Parallel Execution

The pipeline doesn't wait for each step:

```
Phase 1 (sequential): Judge → Timeline → Scene
Phase 2 (parallel):   Characters + Moment + Camera (all at once)
Phase 3 (sequential): Dialog → ImagePrompt → ImageGen
```

## Adding Your Own Agent

1. Create schema: `app/schemas/your_agent.py`
2. Create prompt: `app/prompts/your_agent.py`
3. Create agent: `app/agents/your_agent.py`
4. Wire into pipeline: `app/core/pipeline.py`
5. Add tests: `tests/unit/test_your_agent.py`

All agents follow the same pattern:

```python
class YourAgent:
    async def run(self, input: InputSchema) -> OutputSchema:
        prompt = self._build_prompt(input)
        return await self.router.call(prompt=prompt, response_model=OutputSchema)
```
