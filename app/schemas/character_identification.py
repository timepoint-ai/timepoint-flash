"""Character Identification schema for parallel bio generation.

Phase 1 of two-phase character generation:
1. CharacterIdentification - Fast identification of who's in the scene
2. CharacterBio generation - Parallel detailed bio generation

Examples:
    >>> from app.schemas.character_identification import CharacterStub, CharacterIdentification
    >>> stub = CharacterStub(
    ...     name="Julius Caesar",
    ...     role=CharacterRole.PRIMARY,
    ...     brief_description="Roman dictator at moment of assassination",
    ...     speaks_in_scene=True,
    ...     key_relationships=["Brutus", "Cassius"]
    ... )

Tests:
    - tests/unit/test_character_identification.py
